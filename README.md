Ideas and random thoughts... Just another repository

I'm working on a website, the website won't be too flashy as I plan to use wordpress because I don't know any HTML, PHP, etc. I also have no clue if I should use my name or an unoffical "software company" name. We'll see what happens. Having just learned C# I want to start making games with Unity. I have an agreement with unity that if I make software using their tools I can't make any money off of it. So every game will be open-source and posted here for free digital download.
